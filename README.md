To start up the project, start the server from src/ServerProject and start the clients from src/ClientProject. The server and each client needs its own terminal to run in. The client works by using profiles that can be publishers, subscribers, or both. Three profiles were made that are only publishers, two profiles were made that are only subscribers, and one profile was made that is both a publisher and a subscriber. For documentation on how to use the application go to docs/User Manual. Other documentation can be found in docs/Code Documentation. Feel free to play around with it, creating new profiles, new topics, or playing with the settings of an existing topic.
